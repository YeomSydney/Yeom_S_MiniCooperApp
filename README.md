## Description
Time to put it all together! Use everything weâ€™ve covered so far - SASS, Vue, AJAX, and the Fetch API to create a dynamic one-page app based on our class build. Click on one of the Mini models to show more content / data about that model. You will be navigating around in your app using Vue lifecycle hooks, components, and AJAX where appropriate.
